# Pi Sound&Smart Box

## *Project is still under construction* 

### Pi Smart&Sound Box is a mix of utilities for making your pi an Ultimate Wireless Music Player and a Home-Controller.

   1. For Apple, just connect via AirPlay to RasPi. 
   2. For Spotify (only premium), go to Spotify Connect tab and select RasPi. 
   3. USB Audio Line-In pre-configured for constantly streaming to speakers.
   4. For Apple devices, Homebridge (a HomeKit app bridge) is already installed and using MQTT Plug-In and Node-Red for communication            with Arduino or ESP. Also a      PC-Volume Plug-In for controlling your Pi volumen thru your iPhone.
   5. All of them running as bootable services, so no worries about annoying windows.
